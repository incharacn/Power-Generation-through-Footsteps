# Power-Generation-through-Footsteps

In the present scenario, the requirement for energy has been increasing in a distressing rate and the availability of the energy resources are not abundant for sustainable development and the is to establish an economical pollution free inexhaustible energy resource to compensate the increasing demands. The system generates electricity through the beats of human feet using piezoelectric materials. The pressure due to human weight when applied in the system could be converted to electrical energy for immediate/later use. The system is suitable where there are high volumes of human traffic such as markets, worship centres, shopping malls, bus stations, dancing stages, and parks. It can also be used in powering small electrical appliances and electronic gadgets such as cell phones, radio stereo, television, fan, and streetlights. Since, walking is the most common activity in human day to day life, whenever a person walks, he exhausts energy to the ground which goes as a waste. Hence to make use of this energy, we are converting it into electrical energy using

“Power Generation through footstep” has been successfully tested and concluded to be the best economical, affordable energy solution to common people. This can be used in many applications as mentioned above [8]. India is a developing country where energy management is a big challenge for existing population. This project can contribute to overcome such challenges.
Man has overused and wasted energy resources for his sustenance and well-being ever since he came on the earth a few million years ago. Proposal for the utilization of waste energy of foot power with human locomotion is very much relevant and important for highly populated countries like India and China in future, and the proposed system can be implemented with little advancements which can reduce the total cost and with increased reliability.
We can even integrate the system with solar system and form a hybrid system such that the cost of storage is reduced, and pure clean energy is produced with a high reliability.
